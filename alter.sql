/*
Unlike SQL-standard and other database systems, SQLite supports a very limited functionality of the ALTER TABLE statement.

By using an SQLite ALTER TABLE statement, you can perform two actions:

Rename a table.
Add a new column to a table.
Rename a column (added supported in version 3.20.0)
*/

/*
Using SQLite ALTER TABLE to rename a table
To rename a table, you use the following ALTER TABLE RENAME TO statement:

ALTER TABLE existing_table
RENAME TO new_table;
These are important points you should know before you rename a table:

The ALTER TABLE only renames a table within a database. You cannot use it to move the table between the attached databases.
The database objects such as indexes and triggers associated with the table will be associated with the new table.
If a table is referenced by views or statements in triggers, you must manually change the definition of views and triggers.
Letâ€™s take an example of renaming a table.

First, create a table named devices that has three columns: name, model, serial; and insert a new row into the devices table.
*/
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS devices;

CREATE TABLE devices (
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  model TEXT NOT NULL,
  serial INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO devices (name, model, serial)
VALUES ('HP ZBook 17 G3 Mobile Workstation', 'ZBook', 'SN-2015');
/*
Second, use the ALTER TABLE RENAME TO statement to change the devices table to equipment table as follows:
*/
ALTER TABLE devices
RENAME TO equipment;
/*
Third, query data from the equipment table to verify the RENAME operation.
*/
SELECT
  name,
  model,
  serial
FROM equipment;
